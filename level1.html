<div class="introText">Puss was going through town to find something to eat and came across the king's guard. The king's guard told him that the king is looking for rare unicorns and dragons to keep as pets. The puss went into the forest and set a trap in the tree to catch these creatures, and lied underneath the tree to keep watch. Upon nightfall, puss got awoken by a loud thud and sees several creatures in the trap. As he was laying underneath the tree, he could only observe the number of their feet. At this time, he observed 64 rainbow unicorns' feet and 20 dragons' feet. How many rainbow unicorns and dragons did he catch?</div>
